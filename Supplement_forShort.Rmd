To generate hypotheses about the diets of understudied siphonophores for which no feeding observations have yet been reported (but for which we have tentacle morphology data), we carried out linear discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) using the dapc function (R adegenet::dapc) [@jombart2010discriminant]. This function allowed us to incorporate more predictors than individuals. We generated discriminant functions for feeding guild, soft/hard bodied prey, and for the presence of copepods, fish, and shrimp (large crustaceans) in the diet (Appendix 15). Some taxa have inapplicable states for certain absent characters (such as the length of a nematocyst subtype that is not present in a species), which are problematic for DAPC analyses. We tackled this by transforming the absent states to zeroes. This approach allows us to incorporate all the data, but creates an attraction bias between small character states (*e.g.* small tentilla) and absent states (*e.g.* no tentilla). Absent characters are likely to be very biologically relevant to prey capture and we believe they should be accounted for in a predictive approach. We limited the number of linear discriminant functions retained to the number of groupings in each case. We selected the number of principal components retained using the a-score optimization function (R adegenet::optim.a.score) [@jombart2010discriminant] with 100 iterations, which yielded more stable results than the cross validation function (R adegenet::xval). This optimization aims to find the compromise value with highest discrimination power with the least overfitting. From these DAPCs we obtained the highest contributing morphological characters to the discriminaton (characters in the top quartile of the weighted sum of the linear discriminant loadings controlling for the eigenvalue of each discriminant). For each DAPC we generated hypotheses about the diets of siphonophores outside the training set (R adegenet::predict.dapc), incorporating prediction uncertainty as posterior probabilities (Appendix 15). In order to identify the sign of the relationship between the predictor characters prey type presence in the diet, we then generated generalized logistic regression models (as a type of generalized linear model, or GLM using R stats::glm) with the top contributing characters (from the corresponding DAPC) as predictors. We also carried out these GLMs on the Ivlev’s selectivity indices for each prey type calculated from [@purcell1981dietary] (in Appendix 11).

In order to explore the correlational structure among continuous characters and among their evolutionary histories, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic PCA [@revell2012phytools]. Since the character dataset contains many gaps due to missing characters and inapplicable states, we carried out these analyses on a subset of species and characters that allowed for the most complete dataset. This was done by removing the terminal filament characters (which are only shared by a small subset of species), and then removing species which had inapplicable states for the remaining characters. In addition, we obtained the correlations between the phylogenetic independent contrasts [@felsenstein1985phylogenies] using the package rphylip [@revell2014rphylip].

*Generating dietary hypotheses using tentillum morphology* – The discriminant analysis of principal components for feeding guild (7 principal components, 4 discriminants) produced 100% discrimination, and the highest loading contributions were found for the characters (ordered from highest to lowest): Involucrum length, heteroneme volume, heteroneme number, total heteroneme volume, tentacle width, heteroneme length, total nematocyst volume, and heteroneme width (Appendix 15.1). We used the predictions from this discriminant function to generate hypotheses about the feeding guild of 45 species in our morphological data (Fig. \@(figure6)). This projection predicts that two other *Apolemia* species may also be gelatinous prey specialists like *Apolemia rubriversa*, and that *Erenna laciniata* may be a fish specialist like *Erenna richardi*.

Top quartile variable (character) contributions to the linear discriminants are ordered from highest to lowest. Logistic regressions and GLMs were fitted to predict prey type presence and selectivity respectively. The sign of the slope of each predictor is reported, marked with an asterisk if significant (p value < 0.05), and highlighted grey if it differs between prey presence in diet and prey selectivity. Pseudo-R^2^ (%) approximates the percent variance explained by the model.

  When predicting soft- and hard-bodied prey specialization, the DAPC achieved 90.9% discrimination success, only marginally confounding hard-bodied specialists with generalists (Appendix 15.4). The main characters driving this discrimination are involucrum length, heteroneme number, heteroneme volume, tentacle width, total nematocyst volume, total haploneme volume, elastic strand width, and heteroneme length. Discriminant analyses and GLM logistic regressions were also applied to specific prey type presence and selectivity (Table 2), revealing the sign of their predictive relationship to each prey type. We only selected prey types with sufficient variation in the data to carry out these analyses (copepods, fish, and large crustaceans). While the presence of fish or large crustaceans in the diet cannot be unambiguously discriminated using tentillum morphology (Appendix 15), specialization on fish or large crustacean prey can be fully disentangled (Appendix 15.1). For each prey type studied, tentillum morphology is a much better predictor of prey selectivity than of prey presence in the diet, despite prey selectivity data being available for a smaller subset of species. Interestingly, many of the morphological predictors had opposite slope signs when predicting prey selectivity *versus* predicting prey presence in the diet (Table 2).

*Evolution of tentillum and nematocyst characters* – One third of the characters measured support a non-phylogenetic generative model, indicating they are not phylogenetically conserved (Appendix 12). Total nematocyst volume and cnidoband-to-heteroneme length ratio showed strongly conserved phylogenetic signals. 74% of characters present a significant phylogenetic signal, yet only total nematocyst volume, haploneme length, and heteroneme-to-cnidoband length ratio had a phylogenetic signal with K > 1. 67% of characters support BM models, indicating a history of neutral constant divergence. No relationship between phylogenetic signal and BM model support was found. Haploneme nematocyst length is the only character with support for an EB model of decreasing rate of evolution with time. No character had support for a single-optimum OU model (when uninformed by feeding guild regime priors).

Some branch lengths were modified from the Bayesian chronogram to improve readability. The main visually distinguishable tentillum types are sketched next to the species that bear them, showing the location and arrangement of the main characters. In large, complex-shaped euphysonect tentilla, haplonemes were omitted for simplification. The rhizophysid *Bathyphysa conifera* branch was appended manually as a polytomy (dashed line).](Figures_final/figure7.jpg)

The phylogenetic positions of the main categorical character shifts were reconstructed using stochastic character mapping (Appendix 18), and summarized in Figure 7. Haploneme nematocysts are likely ancestrally present in siphonophore tentacles, since they are present in the tentacles of many other hydrozoans. Haplonemes first diverged into spherical isorhizas of 2 size classes in Cystonectae, and elongated anisorhizas of one size class in Codonophora. Haplonemes were likely lost in the tentacles of *Apolemia*, but spherical isorhizas are retained in other *Apolemia* tissues [@siebert2013re]. Similarly, while heteronemes exist in other tissues of cystonects, they appear in the tentacles of codonophorans exclusively, as birhopaloids in *Apolemia*, ancestral stenoteles in eucladophoran physonects, and microbasic mastigophores in calycophorans. 
  
  Eucladophora (the clade containing Pyrostephidae, Euphysonectae, and Calycophorae, see Fig. \@ref(figure4)) encompasses most of the extant Siphonophore species (178 of 186) other than Cystonects and *Apolemia*. Innovations evolved in the stem of this group include spatially segregated heteroneme and haploneme nematocysts, terminal filaments, and elastic strands (Fig. \@ref(figure7)). Pyrostephids evolved a unique bifurcation of the axial gastrovascular canal of the tentillum known as the "saccus" [@totton1965synopsis]. The stem to the clade Tendiculophora (clade containing Euphysonectae and Calycophorae, see Fig. \@ref(figure4)) subsequently acquired further novelties such as the desmoneme and rhopaloneme (acrophore subtype ancestral) nematocysts on the terminal filament (Fig. \@ref(figure7)), which bears no other nematocyst type (Fig. \@ref(figure1)). These are arranged in sets of 2 parallel rhopalonemes for each single desmoneme [@skaer1988formation;@skaer1991remodelling]. The involucrum is an expansion of the epidermal layer that can cover part or all of the cnidoband (Fig. \@ref(figure2)). This structure, together with differentiated larval tentilla, appeared in the stem branch to Clade A physonects. Calycophorans evolved novelties such as larger desmonemes at the distal end of the cnidoband, pleated pedicles with a “hood” (here considered homologous to the involucrum) at the proximal end of the tentillum, anacrophore rhopalonemes, and microbasic mastigophore-type heteronemes. While calycophorans have diversified into most of the extant described siphonophore species (108 of 186), their tentilla have not undergone any major categorical gains or losses since their most recent common ancestor. Nonetheless, they have spreaded over a broad span of variation in nematocyst and cnidoband sizes.

*Phenotypic integration of the tentillum* – Of the phylogenetic correlations (Fig. \@ref(figure8)a, lower triangle), 81.3% were positive and 18.7% were negative, while of the ordinary correlations (Fig. \@ref(figure8)a, upper triangle) 74.6% were positive and 25.4% were negative. Half (49.9%) of phylogenetic correlations were >0.5, while only 3.6% are < -0.5. Similarly, of the across-species correlations, 49.1% were >0.5 and only 1.5% were < -0.5. We found that 13.9% of character pairs had opposing phylogenetic and ordinary correlation coefficients. Just 4% have negative phylogenetic and positive ordinary correlations (such as rhopaloneme elongation ~ heteroneme-to-cnidoband length ratio and haploneme elongation, or haploneme elongation ~ heteroneme number), and only 9.9% of character pairs had positive phylogenetic correlation yet negative ordinary correlation (such as heteroneme elongation ~ cnidoband convolution and involucrum length, or rhopaloneme elongation with cnidoband length). These disparities can be caused by Simpson’s paradox [@blyth1972simpson]: the reversal of the sign of a relationship when a third variable (or a phylogenetic topology [@uyeda2018rethinking]) is considered. However, no character pair had correlation coefficient differences larger than 0.64 between ordinary and phylogenetic correlations (heteroneme shaft extension ~ rhopaloneme elongation has a Pearson’s correlation of 0.10 and a phylogenetic correlation of  -0.54). Rhopaloneme elongation shows the most incongruencies between phylogenetic and ordinary correlations with other characters.
